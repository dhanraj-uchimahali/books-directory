# Book Directory API with JWT Authentication

This is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing a book directory. It includes JWT authentication to secure the endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- MongoDB installed locally or remotely

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   HTTPS:
   git clone https://github.com/dhanraj-uchimahali/books-directory.git
   
   SSH:
   git clone git@github.com:dhanraj-uchimahali/books-directory.git

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install
   

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables and add your own mongodb url 
   and access token values:

   MONGO_URL = your mongo url

   ACCESS_TOKEN = your secret key
   

4. Start the server:

   npm start
   

## Usage

### Authentication

To access the protected endpoints, you need to obtain a JWT token by sending a POST request to `/v1/login` with valid credentials in the request body:


POST /v1/login

HTTP/1.1

Content-Type: application/json
```
{
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

If the credentials are valid, you will receive a response with a JWT token:


HTTP/1.1 

200 OK
```
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Login Successfully",
    "result": {
        "id": "64c665347851890ae618d04a",
        "username": "john",
        "email": "john@gmail.com",
        "token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImpvaG4iLCJpYXQiOjE2MTk2NjMzODUsImV4cCI6MTYxOTY2Njk4NX0.uqKZn7K4BrOz9LzC1zQHq5K0jJG3mVZ3y-0HqoKfOwE"
    }
}
```

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests:


GET /v1/books 
```
HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImpvaG4iLCJpYXQiOjE2MTk2NjMzODUsImV4cCI6MTYxOTY2Njk4NX0.uqKZn7K4BrOz9LzC1zQHq5K0jJG3mVZ3y-0HqoKfOwE
```
